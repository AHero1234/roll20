Within its \"halls\" are bizarre organs that appear as traps, animated suits of armor to assault intruders, and a confusing maze of corridors.

Taking the disguise of a magical tower, these mimics are extremely intelligent, much to the detriment of their favorite prey: humanoids. On the inside a living mage tower is a strange mix of magic, monster, and building. Its body parts are shielded by mighty spell wards while strange arcane phenomena prevent access to its upper levels.

Whatever the reason, these mimics seem to understand the minds of wizards, for their disguise is by far the most convincing of the behemoth strain. The magic at these creature's disposal is formidable. Each possesses enough firepower to level a small city, let alone a party of intrepid adventurers. They are also far more mobile than their lesser counterparts, teleporting vast distances in an instance in search of gullible prey. Everything about these creatures screams overkill to me. Their strength far outclasses their need to feed on a dozen or so humanoids a year. Theory: the mimic either enjoys inflicting suffering (unlikely) or can only receive meaningful sustenance from powerful \"food\"."
